	/**	@page Board_Integration
	 *	@section bd_source_share				Share the Source
	 *	Designed to be a reusable component, the CWSW Board component is
	 *	organized into a reusable section, and requires additional project-
	 *	specific configuration items in the project.
	 *
	 *	The component layout in your workspace looks like this:
	 *	@code{.sh}

		cwsw_board_prj/
		├── cwsw_board
		│   ├── none
		│   └── pic32mz_efm_sk
		├── doc
		│   └── images
		└── ut

	 *	@endcode
	 *	@note This component is presently under construction; as support is added
	 *	for additional project boards, the exact form of the directory tree
	 *	shown above may change.
	 *	@note Some features have been omitted for clarity.
	 *
	 *	The <code>cwsw_board_prj</code> directory is the home to the various
	 *	project-management files (such as the Doxygen configuration, the Eclipse
	 *	project files, etc.), and is the parent for the component.
	 *
	 *	The <code>ut</code> directory is the source for the developer workspace
	 *	for this reusable component, and illustrates how to configure the
	 *	component is client projects.
	 *
	 *	The <code>doc</code> directory holds relevant design information not
	 *	included in this Doxygen format.
	 *
	 *	The <code>cwsw_board</code> directory is the sharable and reusable portion
	 *	of the component.\n
	 *	The design intent is for this folder to be shared into your project's
	 *	directory structure.
	 *	-	@b Preferred: If your code management system can share folders
	 *		(e.g., PVCS / Dimensions, MKS), this might be a good solution; else,
	 *	-	@b Symlinks: filesystem symlinks are supported by GIT, with
	 *		appropriate configuration options set properly.
	 *	-	Example (using symlinks):\n
	 *	Given the following workspace directory structure:
	 *	@code{.sh}

	 	(workspace)
		├── components
		│   ├── cwsw_arch_prj
		│   ├── cwsw_board_prj
		│   └── cwsw_lib_prj

		    ├── appl_swc
		    ├── cfg
		    ├── drivers
		    ├── libs
		    ├── os
		    ├── rte
		    └── services

	 *	@endcode
	 *	Execute the following. @note This example is given using Cygwin; the same
	 *	command line verbatim would be done in Git Bash.\n
	 *	Also, 7-Zip can create symlinks, and there are other methods in Windows to create symbolic
	 *	links.
	 *
	 *	@code{.sh}

		$ cd cwsw_example_proj/drivers/
		$ ln -s ../../components/cwsw_board_prj/cwsw_arc cwsw_board

	 *	@endcode
	 *	@note The placement above, in the <code> drivers </code> folder, is
	 *	only a suggestion. Wherever you locate it, if you are using filesystem
	 *	symlinks, it is important to use relative symlinks to maintain
	 *	portability from one dev system to another. <em>(If you are using a
	 *	sharing mechanism from your source versioning system, use the most
	 *	appropriate linking or referencing mechanism is appropriate.)</em>

	 *	@code

		$ cd cwsw_example_proj/drivers

	 *	"deeper."
	 *
	 *	To clarify what you're looking for, here is the annotation for each of
	 *	the files in the <code> arch </code> project.
	 *	@note The design intent, is for all references within the project, to be
	 *	relative to the project itself. Portability is greatly reduced when the

	 *	project tree itself.

	 *
	 *	@subsection bd_exclude_undesireables		Exclude Undesired Boards
	 *	Because (at least a portion of) the API that faces "upwards" must be
	 *	the same across all supported architectures, multiple definitions of
	 *	those API functions will exist unless those modules are excluded from
	 *	your build.
	 *
	 *	In Eclipse and IDEs derived from it, the easiest way to do this is to
	 *	specifically exclude a folder from the Project Properties dialog. Here
	 *	is an example: \n
	 *	@image html doc/images/eclipse_exclude_folder_from_build.png	"Exclude Directory Item from Build"
	 *	This same "exclude" checkbox appears in multiple places in the project

	 *
	 *	While not strictly required, it is recommended that the CWSW Library is
	 *	initialized first; following this, the Architecture component can be
	 *	initialized, followed by the Board component.
	 *
	 *	One of the APIs introduced is an abstraction intended to give the same signature to all
	 *	CWSW modules: <code>Init(Component)</code>. This is optional, but when used, looks like
	 *	this:
